#Real Estate Rental Estimatior


The Project aims to train a machine learning model that uses the
Random Forest Regression algorithm, that can estimate as close as possible to 
reality, a price range that should include the monthly rent of an apartment in Bucharest.


Data used for training had over **200.000** entries with rental adds online from Sept. 2019 to Jan. 2021.

A Random Forest Regression model was trained and used for prediction.

The Web Application built with flask uses web crawlers to extract data from different rental ads URLs and 
gives an estimate price range for the rental price.

To run the Web Application you must run `run_flask_app.py`.

The complete description of the project can be found in `Pohrib Eduard-Emanuel - licenta.pdf` file.
